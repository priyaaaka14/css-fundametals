        Competency-based learning is an approach to education that focuses on the student’s demonstration of desired learning outcomes. In regards to tertiary education, problem-based learning is gaining popularity in Australia. Students are given a real-world problem then they work together to find a solution to this. Free education has materialized in the form of eLearning and Massive Open Online Courses as a direct result of students wanting to learn but not having the resources to do so whether that means they don’t have the money or the background to achieve their learning goals.Place-Based Education “immerses students in local heritage, cultures, landscapes, opportunities, and experiences, uses these as a foundation for the study of language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects across the curriculum, and emphasizes learning through participation in service projects for the local school and/or community.<br><br>
        Open innovation promotes the idea of competition. In the business world this means opening up platforms for companies in the form of contests. In higher education, this means bringing together various institutions for competitions locally and globally. It means not confining it to only a select few but opening up to as many contestants as possible.Breaking down the walls of education doesn’t simply mean creating online classrooms but encouraging students to meet in open spaces and learn outside the confines of the institution. Teaching outside the classroom should be a source of inspiration, not a strange phenomenon.Whether students are seeking a specialized higher education or a specific skill in order to further a career path, vocational training has become a more popular avenue and view of education in general. Often used by governments to train displaced workers, it can be a valuable source of study for anyone wanting to specialize in areas such as various types of medical technicians or even graphic arts.<br><br>
